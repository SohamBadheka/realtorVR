# realtorVR

RealtorVR is a platform/website where realtors show different properties, they want to sell. 

Here, the property type can ne an open house or a normal property. 
So realtors can upload the house property and give images/description/details about the house/property they are selling.

But, we also add another feature where end users who want to buy the property, can look into the house/roam around the property by
clicking our VR Demo House. These properties are under construction and realtors want them to be sold in advance, then people who
like it, can book it in advance by checking out the property in VR/360 degree. They can roam around the house so that they can decide whether
or not, they will like the property in future.
